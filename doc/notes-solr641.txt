first pass at code changes, and ansible for updated solr configs.

currently issues where glassfish is getting 404 on solr endpoints during user login (and likely while running the installer):
 - /solr/update
 - /solr/spell

Most likely due to incomplete setup/config of solr 6.4.1.

On hold for the moment.
